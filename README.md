# Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-Algorithm



## Description
The Smart Attendance System is designed to recognize pre-stored images and take attendance using a camera. This system leverages Python and the OpenCV module to capture images and match them with existing records. Once identified, the system automatically updates the attendance in an Excel file.

## Features
- Face recognition using the OpenCV library
- Automatic attendance recording
- Easy-to-use interface for capturing and storing images
- Attendance management using an Excel file

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-Algorithm.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-Algorithm
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Store Images**: Capture and store images of individuals to be recognized.
2. **Run the System**: Start the attendance system using the command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. **Attendance Recording**: The system will use the camera to capture images and match them with pre-stored images. Attendance will be recorded in the `attendance.xlsx` file.
